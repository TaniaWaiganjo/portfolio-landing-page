        <h5>Why I chose software development:</h5>    
            <div class="thewhy">
                <p>I chose computer studies as a staple subject in high school. </p>
                <p>While the syllabus is completely outdated there was a topic called elementary programming which I really enjoyed.</p>
                <p>It dealt with pseudocodes and flowcharts but it made me curious about coding, hence, my choice to pursue software development.</p>
